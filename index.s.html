                <p>Whilst there is little we can do to make the processors more efficient (for that we have to rely on the boffins at Intel, AMD, TI and all the other chip designers out there), but we can ensure that they cost of the

                      <p>100% uptime is our goal, and we know that we can ensure that 99.999% is a reality, not just a fantasy dreamt up on a spreadsheet. How? Well, we've had to change the rules, but once you realise what we have done, you'll
                      	be amazed that people didn't think about doing it before</p>

                        <h1>How do we ensure "five-nines"?</h1>
                        <p><img data-img-src="assets/images/iconmonstr/iconmonstr-monitoring-6-icon-350.png" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Lorem Ipsum">It is relativly simple. Traditional data centre designs assume that the power grid will
                        	dissapear at some point and hence place UPS and generators in-line. Traditionally these have actually been the archilies heel of many a data centre, with problems with the UPS and generator equipment causing most of the
                        	problems.
                        	<p>Sure, you can try and design around this, with N+1, N+2 and even 2xN designs, but one thing is sure, if the UPS or generator decides to go wrong at the exact point that you are relying on them, or even worse, that
                        		a problem with this equipment actually causes an outage, then you have got problems.</p>
                        	<p>So we decided to see if we could find a way of ensuring that our "generator" was actually another power station, and if we could find power stations that don't rely on variables such as getting enough coal delivered,
                        		hoping that the wind blows, or even relying on something like nuclear power that require servicing, and hence shutting down, more frequently than you would think.</p>
                        	<p>We therefore have three types of power delivery to our facility that customers can take advantage of</p>
                        	<p><bold>Triple backed 'grid' power</p>
                        	<p><bold>Grid plus UPS</p>
                        	<p><bold>Grid plus UPS plus local generator</p>
                        	</ul>
                        	<p></p>
                        	<h2>Why three?</h2>
                        	<p>Because our power feeds from the local and regional power stations are not like anything you have been used to.</p>
                        	<p>The electricity that we use has been continiously supplied, <bold>without ANY interruption, for over 
                        	30 years, </bold> and if you delve into the reasons why this is, you'll find it's due to the fact that the water keeps on running down the river, and just on the one river where we are located there are 
                        	<bold>five</bold> powerstations that we connect into.</p>
                        	<p>Not only this, but the river that we have powering our hydro plants is one of the largest rivers in Sweden, it is some 460km long and is fed by some of the largest lakes in the country. This means that the flow
                        		of the river is absolutly guarenteed regardless of the weather and does not significantly vary during the seasons. All of this combines to mean we have a safe, secure and predictable power supply.</p>
                        	<p>It may seem strange that removing UPS and Generators is a way of increasing your reliability, but that is exactly what the maths actually says when you have such a secure way of gaining electricty from the local
                        		hydro powerstations!</p>
                        	<h2>What's the difference between the options?</h2>
                        	<p>The three options give you choices. In essence our standard offering already has multiple backup generators because our power comes from both the local hydro power station directly, but if that was to have any
                        		issues then, without interuption, it moves over to one of the other multiple hydro stations that we have connections to.</p>
                        	<p>UPS and on-site generators are also available, but clearly there is an additional cost to having those facilities.</p>
           					<h2>Which option should I use?</h2>
                        	<p><img data-img-src="assets/images/iconmonstr/iconmonstr-lightbulb-icon-350.png" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Lightbulb">What most of our customers do though is run anything that can be 're-booted' at will off our main supply (front facing web caching servers or bitcoin miners are an ideal example of this), and run critical things where a 
                        		reboot is a real pain and/or would lead to data integrity problems (database servers are a fine example of this) off our +1 or +N service options.
                        	<p>Don't worry, our salesforce can take you through all of the options and help you choose.</p>

                        	cool kit is to use air conditioning equipment which uses more power to cool down the air inside the data centre and expel hot air outside.
                        	<p>But we generally don't need to do that, which means our electricty bill for cooling down the equipment inside our data centre is a fraction of what it would be if you had the same equipment anywhere in mainland Europe</p>
                        	<p>Because Boden has around 360 days a year where the temperature outside is not more than 25C, the air outside is a lot cooler than the air inside the data centre. So we just take that air, clean it to make sure it's suitable for the equipment inside, pick up the heat from
                        		the equipment, and pump it back outside to natually cool.</p>
                        		<p>It's called Free Air Cooling and whilst some datacentres around the world use it, they can't use it for as many days as we do. This gives us a massive cost advantage, but also our impact on the environment is much
                        			smaller which is great for everyone.</p>

                        	and your service runs as best as it possibly can.</p>
                        <p>Words like "can do", "no problem",. "sure", "I'll do that, no worries" are easy to say, but hard to do in practice. Our backers are people that have spent the last 20 years growing companies that not only
                        	win many Industry awards for customer service, but actually have a reputation for proving one of the best services in their market place.</p>
                        	<p>For us it's easy, you are the customer and you shouldn't have to rely omn trying to get things done, you should just ask for what you want and we'll do our best to ensure that is what you get.</p>
                        <p>Old fashioned customer service in a state of the art facility? That's exactly what we are aiming to achieve, and our customer's tell us that's exactly what we do.</p>
